# PCA+DIRIE Pruning
This repository contains the implementation of our pruning methodology, named PCA+DIRIE, on top of the ResNet-50 and Transformer DNNs from the Tensorflow Model Garden [[1]](#1).

# Running:
All the required scripts for training a baseline model, performing the pruning, and finally the retraining are included in the correspoding "scripts" fodler of each model.
